This folder contains all the CSP environment benchmarks that have been evaluated in the Case study section of the paper.

In detail, this folder contains:

1. CSPFiles/ : Folder that contains unflattened CSP for the arbiter case-study and thermostat case study
2. *.csp: Flattened CSP for all benchmarks analysed in the paper
---- exampleN.csp : Illustrative Example N from Section 7.2.1
---- thermostatflat.csp : Flattened thermostat obtained by flattening CSPFiles/therostat.csp (Section 7.2.2)
---- arbiterNflat.csp: Flattened arbiter with N processes obtained by flattening CSPFiles/arbiterN.csp (Section 7.2.3)


-----------------------------
Flattening an unflattened CSP
-----------------------------

This is done by using ../pycsp/fdrextract.py

../pycsp/fdrextract.py is a translator from FDR CSPM (unflattened CSP)  to simple CSP (flattened CSP) format.

It is run as follows:

python ../pycsp/fdrextract.py <filename> <environment-process-name>

E.g.

python ../pycsp/fdrextract.py CSPFiles/thermostat.csp ENV

Flattened CSP File format

We disect example0.csp for clarity.

chan cA1 : {a0, a1};             // Indicates the Public events. Here a0 and a1 are public events. 

initial E;                       // Indicates the iniital state of the CSP. Here it is E. 

E  := a0 -> E0 | a1 -> STOP;     //CSP Description. Follows the syntax described in Section 3.1
E0 := a0 -> E0;
E1 := b -> E1;
