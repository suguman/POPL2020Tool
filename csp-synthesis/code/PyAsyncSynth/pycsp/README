This folder contains two major prototypes.

1. fdrextract.py (Runs on Python 2.x.y)

   Translator from FDR CSPM (unflattened CSP) to simple CSP (flattened) format
   From this folder, it is run as follows:

   $ python fdrextract.py <filename> <environment-process-name>

   E.g.

   $ python fdrextract.py ../poplbenchmarks/CSPFiles/thermostat.csp ENV


2. run.py (Runs on Python 3.x.y)

   Our coordination synthesis tool.
   It takes a flattened CSP environment E, safety LTL specification S and liveness LTL specification L, and synthesizes a controller C such that C ||| E satisies (S, L), if such a controller exists. If such a controller doesn't exist, the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate after time double exponential in size of S and L, and PSPACE-hard in size of E.

   Execute the following to see input format

   $ python3 run.py -h

   E.g. When flat CSP environment is stored in ../poplbenchmarks/thermostatflat.csp,
        Safety spec is "false", and
	Liveness spec is "GF(justRight),
	execute the following command:

   $  python3 run.py -e ../poplbenchmarks/thermostatflat.csp -s 'false' -l 'GF(justRight)' -o ../poplbenchmarks/thermostatflat.sys
   
   Note:: Here  ../poplbenchmarks/thermostatflat.sys is the rootname of all intermediate files that will be generated.
